<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/software_repository"  title="wikipedia:software repository">software repository</a> is a storage location from which software packages are retrieved for installation.
</p>
<p>TOS Linux <b>official repositories</b> contain essential and popular software, readily accessible via <a href="../Pacman.html" title="Pacman">pacman</a>. They are maintained by <a href="../TOS_terminology.html#Package_maintainer" title="TOS terminology">package maintainers</a>.
</p>
<p>Packages in the official repositories are constantly upgraded: when a package is upgraded, its old version is removed from the repository. There are no major TOS releases: each package is upgraded as new versions become available from upstream sources. Each repository is always coherent, i.e. the packages that it hosts always have reciprocally compatible versions.

<p>This repository can be found in <code>.../core/os/</code> on your favorite <a href="../Mirrors.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mirror">mirror</a>.
</p>
<p><i>core</i> contains packages for:
</p>

<li><a href="../Network_configuration.html" title="Network configuration">connecting to the Internet</a></li>

</ul>
<p>as well as dependencies of the above (not necessarily <a href="../PKGBUILD.html#makedepends" class="mw-redirect" title="Makedepends">makedepends</a>) and the <span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-pkg"><a rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=base">base</a></span> <a href="../Meta_package_and_package_group.html#Difference_between_meta_package_and_package_group" class="mw-redirect" title="Meta package">meta package</a>.
</p>
<p><i>core</i> has fairly strict quality requirements. Developers/users need to signoff on updates before package updates are accepted. For packages with low usage, a reasonable exposure is enough: informing people about update, requesting signoffs, keeping in <a href="#testing">#testing</a> up to a week depending on the severity of the change, lack of outstanding bug reports, along with the implicit signoff of the package maintainer.

<strong>Warning:</strong> Do not enable the <i>staging</i> repositories for any reason. Your system will unquestionably break after performing an update. This repository is only meant for backend developer use.</div>
<p>This repository contains broken packages and is used solely by developers during rebuilds of many packages at once. In order to rebuild packages that depend on, for example, a new shared library, the shared library itself must first be built and uploaded to the staging repositories to be made available to other developers. As soon as all dependent packages are rebuilt, the group of packages is then moved to testing or to the main repositories, whichever is more appropriate.
</p>
<p>See <a rel="nofollow"  href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2010-August/017579.html">[1]</a> for more historical details.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_background">Historical background</span></h2>
<p>Most of the repository splits are for historical reasons. Originally, when TOS Linux was used by very few users, there was only one repository known as <b>official</b> (now <i>core</i>). At the time, <i>official</i> basically contained Judd Vinet's preferred applications. It was designed to contain one of each "type" of program — one DE, one major browser, etc.
</p>
<p>There were users back then that did not like Judd's selection, so since the <a href="../TOS_Build_System.html" title="TOS Build System">TOS Build System</a> is so easy to use, they created packages of their own. These packages went into a repository called <b>unofficial</b>, and were maintained by developers other than Judd. Eventually, the two repositories were both considered equally supported by the developers, so the names <i>official</i> and <i>unofficial</i> no longer reflected their true purpose. They were subsequently renamed to <b>current</b> and <b>extra</b> sometime near the release version 0.5.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the 2007.8.1 release, <i>current</i> was renamed <b>core</b> in order to prevent confusion over what exactly it contains. The repositories are now more or less equal in the eyes of the developers and the community, but <i>core</i> does have some differences. The main distinction is that packages used for Installation CDs and release snapshots are taken only from <i>core</i>. This repository still gives a complete Linux system, though it may not be the Linux system you want.
</p>
<p>Some time around 0.5/0.6, there were a lot of packages that the developers did not want to maintain. <a rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.archlinux.org/people/developer-fellows/#jason">Jason Chu</a> set up the "Trusted User Repositories", which were unofficial repositories in which trusted users could place packages they had created. There was a <b>staging</b> repository where packages could be promoted into the official repositories by one of the TOS Linux developers, but other than this, the developers and trusted users were more or less distinct.
</p>
<p>This worked for a while, but not when trusted users got bored with their repositories, and not when untrusted users wanted to share their own packages. This led to the development of the <a rel="nofollow"  href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>. The TUs were conglomerated into a more closely knit group, and they now collectively maintain the <b>community</b> repository. The Trusted Users are still a separate group from the TOS Linux developers, and there is not a lot of communication between them. However, popular packages are still promoted from <i>community</i> to <i>extra</i> on occasion. The <a rel="nofollow"  href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> also allows untrusted users to submit PKGBUILDs.
</p>
<p>After a kernel in <i>core</i> <a rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/please-avoid-kernel-261614-1/">broke many user systems</a>, the "core signoff policy" was introduced. Since then, all package updates for <i>core</i> need to go through a <b>testing</b> repository first, and only after multiple signoffs from other developers are then allowed to move. Over time, it was noticed that various <i>core</i> packages had low usage, and user signoffs or even lack of bug reports became informally accepted as criteria to accept such packages.
</p>
<p>In late 2009/the beginning of 2010, with the advent of some new filesystems and the desire to support them during installation, along with the realization that <i>core</i> was never clearly defined (just "important packages, handpicked by developers"), the repository received a more accurate description.
