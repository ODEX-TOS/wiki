Navigating in our operating system is very important if you wish to speed up your workflow. And of course to become more aware on how to use your system to its full potential.

## Learn The Keybindings

All these keybindings will be about the Tiling Window manager. Of course there are more keybindings in specific applications. Those will not be covered here.

## Keybindings - basics
The mod key equals your windows key.

- To open up the application launcher use `mod+d`
- To open up a terminal use `mod+Enter`
- To kill a program use `mod+q`
- To move to another workspace use `mod+number` where number is a number between 0 and 7
- To make a application fullscreen use `mod+f`

## Keybindings - good to know

- To open up a cheatsheet use `mod+f1`
- To move a application to another workspace use `mod+shift+number` where number is a number between 0 and 7
- Move the current focus to the next window using `mod+arrow_key`
- Move the current window to a direction using `mod+shift+arrow_key`
- To move automatically to a different applications use `mod+s`

## Toggle floating mode
Floating mode is the mode where applications are "free" from the tiling paradigm. The can have the resolution they want and you can move them freely. Much like the traditional window managers do.
All you need to do to enable this mode is use `mod+c`

>If you forgot any of these keybindings you can always use `mod+f1` to see a full list
