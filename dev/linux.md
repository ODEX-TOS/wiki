# Linux
Before we get started. Here is a quick list of everything you should know.

[The repo](https://github.com/ODEX-TOS/linux)
[kernel FAQ](https://www.kernel.org/category/faq.html)
[Upstream Kernel](https://git.archlinux.org/linux.git)

The TOS kernel closely follows the arch linux kernel.
Most configurations should remain the same as upstream.

Only submit patches if they are really needed.

In case this bug is major try to submit the patch to the arch linux kernel first.
We will then later merge it into our kernel.
