# Welcome
TOS is an operating system developed by `Tom Meyers`
The idea has been created because of one main reason.
Installing arch always took a lot of time.
After you installed it and had all software installed you spend an entire day of work.
TOS aims to provide all benefits of arch but with next to no time spent preparing everything.
The project is very similar to `Manjaro` however they solve this problem a bit different.
The TOS repo's follow Arch very strictly while Manjaro does not.

TOS GNU/Linux is an operating system designed to be lightweight yet modern.
This operating system is designed to be Rolling Release It supports most hardware and can run on low end systems while still retaining all functionality.

> These types of operating systems get updates very fast. This means you will always have the latest versions of you software. The drawback is that you need to update frequently (you can still choose when) and that there is a small change something breaks

## Default applications/features

TOS uses the awesome window manager by default combined with sddm as the display manager.
The default user shell is `zsh` combined with `oh-my-zsh` for a better user experience.
We also install `firefox-developer-edition` and `visual-studio-code-insiders` to make your browsing and editing more pleasant.
`tlp` is installed by default to consume less energy the normal linux installations.
We also detect things like `ssd trim support` to extend the live of your ssd's and support `amd-ucode` and `intel-ucode` for near instant zero day cpu bug fixes.
All other default features compare to the default settings of `Arch Linux` with a boost of the tos configuration.
