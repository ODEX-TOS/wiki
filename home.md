TOS is an operating system developed by `Tom Meyers`
The idea has been created because of one main reason.
Installing arch always took a lot of time.
After you installed it and had all software installed you spend an entire day of work.
TOS aims to provide all benefits of arch but with next to no time spent preping everything.
The project is very simular to `Manjaro` however they solve this problem a bit different.
The TOS repo's follow Arch very strictly while Manjaro does not.

Below is some information to help you get started!
